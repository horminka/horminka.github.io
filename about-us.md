# What do we do?

  * We satisfy society’s needs using science and
  technology

  * We promote the generation of ideas from individuals and the community,
  while contributing to develop their full potential

  * We create and disseminate knowledge for the benefit of the society

  * We promote critical thinking in relation to science and technology:
  their economic, social, cultural and environmental implications


# Why do we do it?

Some figures can provide insight regarding the current state of science
and technology in Colombia. On the one hand, the latest PISA (Programme
for International Student Assessment) study reveals that 70% of the
Colombian students that took this test scored below acceptable levels in
the field of information technology. On the other hand, the Digital
Literacy Survey shows that 45% of Colombians have only a basic notion
concerning technology. Finally, investment for science and technology in
Colombia represents only 0,23% of the GDP, falling behind compared to
the average for Latin America and the Caribbean with 0,82%, Brazil with
1,15% and much lower than the average for OECD member countries with
2,47%.

We decided to take the lead and to act as change agents. We strongly
believe in people’s potential, we feel that is our responsibility to
take action in order to use knowledge as a tool for helping to solve the
country’s needs. We know for a certainty that only together is possible
to build a society where the free access to knowledge and new
technologies will allow collaborative work and real sharing economies.

# How do we do it?

  * We offer seminars, workshops, conferences and space for discussions that encourage the creation, dissemination and social appropriation of
  knowledge

international institutions, to support initiatives aligned with the

# Core Issues

  * **Environment, Sustainability and Climate Change**  
An infinite-growth economic model can not be supported by a planet with finite resources. A better understanding of the   effect of human activities on the planet is the first step to find balance between economy, society and environment.   Rational use of natural resources might promote economic activity, reduce poverty and an overall improvement of the standard  of living. Some of the topics we cover are: 

    * Appropriate Technology

    * Renewable Energy

    * Sustainability Ethics

    * Food Security

  * **Technologic Sovereignity**  
Technologic sovereignity recognizes the importance of collective empowerment of the new communication tecnologies.  Therefore, setting the basis for a more self-aware and responsible society, capable to use, to create and to master these  tools. Some of the topics we cover are: 

    * Technological Literacy

    * Free Software and Hardware

    * Digital Security and Privacy

    * Critical Analysis on Technology

  * **Free Culture and Community**  
Throughout history, knowledge has been created by accumulation, transmission and repetition, building on top of what was  previously buit. Nevertheless, this paradigm has been controverted in recent times, limiting knowledge development and  society advancement. [Libre knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libre_(word)#Libre_knowledge) aims to defend knowledge as a public good, product of collective work, which sole  purpose is society advancement. Some of the topics we cover are:  

    * Collaborative Work
 
    * Free Licenses

    * Collaborative Economies
