# Donations

HorMinka is a non-profit organization founded in the city of Neiva (south of Colombia) by a group of young professionals who decided to bet on regional development and to use science and technology as a tool for social advancement. Naturally, several of the oragnizationâ€™s activities bring forth a deep social impact (digital literacy, community technology projetcs, construction of public politics concerning science and technology, etc.). To ensure the completion of these activities and the sustainability of HorMinka, we need resources. You can support the development of science and technology in this region by donating money or goods (computers, tools, furniture) to our organization.

As a legally constituted organization we can issue donation certificates valid for tax exemption. Additionally, every donation will be publicly credited, if that is your wish. Your donations guarantee  the continuity and progress of our work.

**Thank you!**
